## Getting started

You'll need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) to run locally. To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Favicons

Edit `public/favicon.svg` (orange symbol, transparent background), then run
`node scripts/generate-favicons.mjs` to regenerate and check the PNG/ICO assets.
Apple touch icons retain an opaque charcoal background for iOS.
The generator uses Sharp, already installed with Next.js. Keep the icon URLs
stable; Google refreshes its cached favicon after recrawling the deployed site.

## Editing docs content

Our docs are generated. Use the following steps to make adjustments to the content and update the website to match:

- make your edits to the documentation in the `api-code-examples/api.mjs` file
- cd into the `scripts` folder
- run `npm install` if you have not run it in this folder previously
- run `node generate-api-pages.js` to generate the doc files for the website
